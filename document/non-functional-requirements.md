# Non-Functional Requirements: Sophisticate Phrase

This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the "Sophisticate Phrase" application, detailing the quality attributes, operational considerations, and constraints that define the system's overall performance and user experience.

## 1. Performance

*   **Response Time**:
    *   Key user operations (e.g., user login, phrase list import, phrase list display) should complete within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., under 2 seconds).
    *   Phrase list import processing should aim for efficient handling of file sizes (e.g., a 1MB CSV file processed within 5 seconds).
*   **Throughput**:
    *   The system should maintain stable service delivery even with an increasing number of concurrent users (e.g., capable of handling X concurrent users).
*   **Resource Utilization Efficiency**:
    *   Efficiently utilize server resources such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O to optimize operational costs.

## 2. Security

*   **Authentication**:
    *   User authentication must be implemented using secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).
    *   Session management should include measures against session hijacking and fixation (e.g., regular session ID regeneration, mandatory HTTPS).
*   **Authorization**:
    *   Users must only be able to access their own phrase lists and not other users' data.
*   **Input Validation**:
    *   All user inputs (form data, file uploads, etc.) must undergo strict validation to prevent vulnerabilities such such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Data Protection**:
    *   User passwords must be stored as hashes, not in plain text.
    *   All communication must be enforced over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping.

## 3. Scalability

*   **Horizontal Scaling**:
    *   The architecture should support scaling out by adding more server instances if user numbers or data volume increase in the future (Dockerization provides a foundation for this).
*   **Database**:
    *   PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness and scalability, suitable for handling increasing data volumes and concurrent users.

## 4. Availability

*   **Uptime**:
    *   The service aims for a high uptime percentage (e.g., 99.9% monthly).
*   **Disaster Recovery**:
    *   Mechanisms for rapid service recovery in case of server failures or application errors should be considered (e.g., log collection, monitoring).
*   **Backup**:
    *   Establish procedures for regular database backups and recovery.

## 5. Maintainability

*   **Code Quality**:
    *   Write readable and testable code following Rust conventions.
    *   Utilize appropriate comments, documentation, and type hints.
*   **Testability**:
    *   The system structure should facilitate easy writing and execution of unit and integration tests.
*   **Deployment Ease**:
    *   Automate and simplify the deployment process using Docker and potentially Ansible.

## 6. Operability

*   **Monitoring**:
    *   Implement mechanisms to monitor application status, performance, and errors (e.g., logs, metrics).
*   **Logging**:
    *   Ensure proper logging of application operations, errors, and security events.
*   **Alerting**:
    *   Implement a system to automatically notify relevant personnel upon detection of anomalies.
